I am currently a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellow (employed as RTT). I work between the <a href="https://www.dmif.uniud.it/en/">Department of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Physics</a> of the <a href="http://www.uniud.it">University of Udine</a> (Udine, Italy), and the <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/cvr/">Centre for Vision Research</a> at <a href="https://www.yorku.ca">York University</a> (Toronto, Canada). 

I come from Tarvisio, a small town located in the Italian Alps. I received the BSc and MSc in Computer Science and the PhD in Industrial and Information Engineering from the <a href="http://www.uniud.it">University of Udine</a> in 2016, 2018, and 2022 respectively. I have been a visiting student at the <a href="https://www.roboticvision.org">Australian Centre for Robotic Vision</a> of the <a href="https://www.qut.edu.au">Queensland University of Technology</a> (Brisbane, Australia). More recently, I spent time as a visiting researcher at the <a href="https://www.mit.edu">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (Cambridge, USA), and at the <a href="https://uah.es/en/">University of Alcalà</a> (Madrid, Spain).

My research interests revolve around <strong style="font-weight: 600">deep learning</strong> for <strong style="font-weight: 600">computer vision</strong>, in particular I like to develop <strong style="font-weight: 600">visual object tracking</strong> algorithms.
