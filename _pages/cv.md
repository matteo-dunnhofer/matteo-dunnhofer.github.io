I am currently a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellow, employed as a Tenure-Track Researcher (RTT). I work between the <a href="https://www.dmif.uniud.it/en/">Department of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Physics</a> of the <a href="http://www.uniud.it">University of Udine</a> (Udine, Italy), and the <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/cvr/">Centre for Vision Research</a> at <a href="https://www.yorku.ca">York University</a> (Toronto, Canada). Prior to that, I was a Research Fellow (RTD-a) in the same department and a postdoc in the <a href="https://machinelearning.uniud.it">Machine Learning and Perception Lab</a> of the same institute. I also spent time as a visiting researcher at the <a href="https://www.mit.edu">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (Cambridge, USA), and at the <a href="https://uah.es/en/">University of Alcalà</a> (Madrid, Spain).

I received the BSc and MSc in Computer Science from the <a href="http://www.uniud.it">University of Udine</a> in 2016 and 2018 respectively. At the same institute, I obtained the PhD in Industrial and Information Engineering in 2022 supervised by <a href="https://users.dimi.uniud.it/~christian.micheloni/">Prof. Christian Micheloni</a>. During my Master's, I have been a visiting student at the <a href="https://www.roboticvision.org">Australian Centre for Robotic Vision</a> of the <a href="https://www.qut.edu.au">Queensland University of Technology</a> (Brisbane, Australia). 

The goal of my research is to let machines sense and understand object dynamics in videos by learning from real-world examples. More specifically, I do research on <strong>deep learning</strong> algorithms for <strong>computer vision</strong>, in particular for <strong>visual object tracking</strong>. I am also interested in applying such methods in <strong>medical image analysis</strong> to let computers improve people's health, and into the <strong>sport</strong> domain for video-based performance analysis. On these topics, I published several papers in international conferences and journals, and I received an award for winning the <a href="https://www.votchallenge.net/vot2021/">Visual Object Tracking VOT2021 long-term challenge</a> held at <a href="http://iccv2021.thecvf.com">ICCV 2021</a>.

I serve as reviewer for the most relevant conferences and journals in computer vision (CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ACCV, WACV, TPAMI, IJCV), pattern recognition (ICPR, PR), robotics (ICRA, RA-L), and medical image analysis (MIDL, MedIA, TMI). I was recognized as an <a href="https://eccv2022.ecva.net/program/outstanding-reviewers/">outstanding reviewer by ECCV 2022</a>. I have been involved in the organization of a series of workshops on <a href="https://machinelearning.uniud.it/events/CV4WS-2023/Home.html">Computer Vision for Winter Sports</a> at <a href="https://wacv2023.thecvf.com/home">WACV</a> and of <a href="https://epic-kitchens.github.io/2023#tracking">object tracking challenges</a> at <a href="https://cvpr2023.thecvf.com">CVPR</a>. I am also an associate editor of <a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/371">The Visual Computer</a> journal.
