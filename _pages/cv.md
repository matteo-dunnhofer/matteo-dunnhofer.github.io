bio

I am currently a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellow (as RTT). I work between the <strong><a href="https://www.dmif.uniud.it/en/">Department of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Physics</a></strong> of the <strong><a href="http://www.uniud.it">University of Udine</a></strong> (Udine, Italy), and the <strong><a href="https://www.yorku.ca/cvr/">Centre for Vision Research</a></strong> at <strong><a href="https://www.yorku.ca">York University</a></strong> (Toronto, Canada). 
    <!--I work within the <strong><a href="https://machinelearning.uniud.it">Machine Learning and Perception Lab</a></strong>.</p> -->

  <p class="text-about-me">I come from Tarvisio, a small town located in the Italian Alps. I received the BSc and MSc in Computer Science and the PhD in Industrial and Information Engineering from the <strong><a href="http://www.uniud.it">University of Udine</a></strong> in 2016, 2018, and 2022 respectively. I have been a visiting student at the <strong><a href="https://www.roboticvision.org">Australian Centre for Robotic Vision</a></strong> of the <strong><a href="https://www.qut.edu.au">Queensland University of Technology</a></strong> (Brisbane, Australia). More recently, I spent time as a visiting researcher at the <strong><a href="https://www.mit.edu">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a></strong> (Cambridge, USA), and at the <strong><a href="https://uah.es/en/">University of Alcalà</a></strong> (Madrid, Spain).</p>

  <p class="text-about-me">The goal of my research is to let machines sense and understand object dynamics in videos by learning from real-world examples.
  More specifically, I do research on <strong>deep learning</strong> algorithms for <strong>computer vision</strong>, in particular for <strong>visual object tracking</strong>. 
  <!-- I am also interested in applying such methods in <strong>medical image analysis</strong> to let computers improve people's health, and into the <strong>sport</strong> domain for video-based performance analysis. -->
    On these topics, I published several papers in international conferences and journals, and I received an award for winning the <a href="https://www.votchallenge.net/vot2021/">Visual Object Tracking VOT2021 long-term challenge</a> held at <a href="http://iccv2021.thecvf.com">ICCV 2021</a>.

  <p class="text-about-me">I serve as reviewer for the most relevant conferences and journals in computer vision<!-- (CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, WACV, TPAMI, IJCV)-->, pattern recognition<!-- (ICPR, PR)-->, robotics<!-- (ICRA, RA-L)-->, and medical image analysis<!-- (MIDL, MedIA, TMI)-->. I was recognized as an <a href="https://eccv2022.ecva.net/program/outstanding-reviewers/">outstanding reviewer by ECCV 2022</a>. I have been involved in the organization of a series of workshops on <a href="https://machinelearning.uniud.it/events/CV4WS-2023/Home.html">Computer Vision for Winter Sports</a> at <a href="https://wacv2023.thecvf.com/home">WACV</a> and of <a href="https://epic-kitchens.github.io/2023#tracking">object tracking challenges</a> at <a href="https://cvpr2023.thecvf.com">CVPR</a>. I am also an associate editor of <a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/371">The Visual Computer</a> journal.</p>
